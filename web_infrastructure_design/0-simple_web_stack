Explanation:
- foobar.com has an A record (or CNAME for www) pointing to 8.8.8.8
- Userâ€™s browser resolves DNS and sends an HTTP request to the server
- Nginx handles the request and forwards it to the application server
- The application server executes code, communicates with MySQL, and returns a response
- Nginx sends back the HTTP response to the user

Issues:
- Single Point of Failure
- No load balancing or redundancy
- Downtime during deployments/restarts
- Cannot scale beyond the resources of one machine
