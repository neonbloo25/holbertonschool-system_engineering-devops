Components and Roles
---------------------

1. Load Balancer (HAProxy)
   - Distributes incoming traffic between Server 1 and Server 2.
   - Distribution Algorithm: Round Robin (evenly cycles through servers).
   - Configuration: Active-Active
     - Active-Active: Both servers handle traffic simultaneously.
     - Active-Passive: One server handles traffic, another stays idle until failure.

2. Servers (Server 1 and Server 2)
   - Each contains:
     - Nginx: Web server that handles static files and proxies to application server.
     - Application Server: Hosts application logic.
     - Application Code Base: The websiteâ€™s source code.
     - MySQL Replica DB: Read-only database that syncs with the primary DB.

3. MySQL Database Cluster
   - Primary Node:
     - Handles all write operations (INSERT, UPDATE).
   - Replica Nodes:
     - Handle read operations.
     - Replicate data asynchronously from the primary node.

Infrastructure Issues
----------------------

1. Single Points of Failure (SPOFs)
   - Load Balancer: If it fails, the site becomes unavailable.
   - Primary Database: If it fails, write operations stop (read-only mode remains).

2. Security Issues
   - No firewall: All services are publicly accessible.
   - No HTTPS: Traffic is not encrypted.
   - No intrusion detection, fail2ban, or Web Application Firewall.

3. Monitoring and Observability
   - No system monitoring or health checks.
   - No logging, alerting, or failure notifications.
