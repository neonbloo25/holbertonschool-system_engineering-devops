Infrastructure Components and Purpose
-------------------------------------

1. Additional Load Balancer
   - Added to prevent single point of failure at the entry level.
   - Load balancers are now clustered in **Active-Active** configuration.
   - Provides redundancy and fault tolerance.

2. Additional Web Server
   - Helps distribute incoming HTTP traffic.
   - Improves scalability and handles more concurrent users.

3. Dedicated Application Servers
   - Application logic separated from web layer.
   - Improves performance, simplifies scaling.

4. Dedicated Database Server
   - Centralized database improves data consistency.
   - Simplifies management and backup.

Web Server vs. Application Server
---------------------------------

- **Web Server (Nginx)**:
  - Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
  - Handles HTTP(S) requests.
  - Acts as a reverse proxy to forward dynamic requests to the app server.

- **Application Server**:
  - Processes dynamic content and business logic.
  - Runs backend code (e.g., Python, Node.js, PHP, Java).
  - Responds to requests forwarded from the web server.

Why Each Component Was Added
----------------------------

- **New Server**:
  - To expand infrastructure capacity and improve high availability.
- **Load Balancer Cluster**:
  - Prevents outage if one load balancer fails.
  - Ensures continuous availability of www.foobar.com.
- **Split Web, App, and DB Servers**:
  - Promotes separation of concerns.
  - Each component can scale independently.
  - Easier to troubleshoot, secure, and optimize.
